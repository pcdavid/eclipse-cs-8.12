<h1 id="p2-repository-for-eclipse-checkstyle-v8.12.0">p2 Repository for Eclipse CheckStyle v8.12.0</h1>
<p><a href="https://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs/">Eclipse CheckStyle</a> used to host its p2 repos on <a href="https://bintray.com/">Bintray</a>, but that service <a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/">is not available anymore</a>.</p>
<p>The project has now moved to a new URL, <a href="http://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs-update-site/" class="uri">http://checkstyle.org/eclipse-cs-update-site/</a>, but that repo only contains recent versions (starting from v8.41). See <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/eclipse-cs/issues/279">the GitHub Issue</a> for more details.</p>
<p>For projects which are stuck on older versions, there is no simple recourse. In our case, <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius">Eclipse Sirius</a> is still using a CheckStyle configuration from the very old CheckStyle 8.12, hence this project to make the corresponding p2 repo for that specific version available more easily (until we migrate to a more recent version).</p>
